# Cloudflare Pages Configuration for SimPilot
# 
# This file is for Pages deployment only.
# For Git-integrated Pages projects, the deploy command should be empty in the dashboard.
#
# DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
#   1. Git Integration: Connect repo in Cloudflare Dashboard → auto-deploys on push
#   2. Wrangler CLI: `wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=simpilot`
#   3. GitHub Actions: See .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml

name = "simpilot"
pages_build_output_dir = "dist"

# Compatibility settings for Cloudflare Workers runtime (if using Functions in future)
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

# Note: [build] and [site] sections are for Workers, not Pages
# Pages projects don't need these sections

# SECURITY NOTE:
# This is a static SPA frontend. All secrets and authentication should be handled via:
#   - Cloudflare Access / Zero Trust for access control
#   - Backend APIs for data operations (if applicable)
#
# Do NOT embed secrets in frontend code. Environment variables prefixed with VITE_
# are bundled into the client-side code and visible to end users.
