## 1. PROBLEMS THIS SOLVES

### Business Pain Points Without SimPilot

#### A. Data Fragmentation & Manual Tracking (The Biggest Problem)

**What's the issue?**

- Manufacturing projects involve hundreds of simulation data points spread across Excel files, emails, and different systems
- Teams manually consolidate data from multiple sources—taking hours per week
- Nobody has a single source of truth, leading to conflicting information
- Changes get lost or duplicated when people work from different versions

**Real-world impact:**

- A 200-station assembly line project requires tracking progress for each station across multiple phases
- Without centralization, engineers spend 10+ hours/week just gathering data instead of solving problems
- Decision-makers base decisions on incomplete or outdated information

#### B. Visibility Into Project Health & Risks

**What's the issue?**

- Project managers can't see the full picture of what's at risk or how late things are
- Problems are discovered late (sometimes after expensive rework)
- Risk escalation is reactive instead of preventive
- Teams don't know which stations will miss deployment deadlines until it's too late

**Real-world impact:**

- A 3-month project delay costs $500K+ for a major automotive assembly line
- Without early warning, teams can't reallocate resources in time
- Schedule changes cascade through projects, affecting all dependent timelines

#### C. Robot Simulation Progress Tracking

**What's the issue?**

- Tracking when robot programming simulations are complete is done manually
- No visibility into completion status across multiple phases (pre-sim, offline programming, on-site)
- Engineers can't identify bottlenecks or dependencies in the simulation workflow
- Projects miss deployment deadlines because simulation status wasn't visible

**Real-world impact:**

- Each robot station might take 2-4 weeks for complete simulation
- Without tracking, you don't know which simulations are blocking deployment
- Entire assembly line ramp-up can be delayed waiting for one incomplete simulation

#### D. Data Quality Issues Going Undetected

**What's the issue?**

- Bad data enters the system and propagates through planning
- Duplicate entries (same tool with different names) cause confusion
- Missing critical asset information (sourcing, status) leads to wrong decisions
- Ingestion errors are discovered late, after decisions have been made

**Real-world impact:**

- A wrong tool assignment could lead to a $50K+ procurement mistake
- Duplicate asset records cause engineers to order duplicates by mistake
- Asset sourcing issues aren't discovered until implementation, causing delays

#### E. Asset & Tool Management Fragmentation

**What's the issue?**

- Tools, robots, and station information lives in multiple systems
- No single registry of assets showing real-time status and sourcing
- Tracking tool availability and reuse is manual and error-prone
- Bottlenecks in tool sourcing aren't visible until it's too late

**Real-world impact:**

- $200K+ in tooling costs can be wasted on duplicate or redundant purchases
- Assembly line ramp-up delayed waiting for tools that were unknown to be short
- Teams can't see which tools/robots could be reused from previous projects

#### F. Deployment Readiness Uncertainty

**What's the issue?**

- No standardized way to assess if a station is ready for deployment
- Deployment goes ahead without confirmation that all prerequisites are met
- Quality issues discovered at plant floor (expensive to fix)
- Ramp-up schedules built without confidence in actual readiness

**Real-world impact:**

- Sending unprepared stations to the plant floor can cause $1M+ in remediation costs
- Project delays while urgent fixes are implemented on-site
- Safety issues if robot programming or tool setup is incomplete

## 6. REAL-WORLD IMPACT EXAMPLES

### Example 1: The $500K Schedule Delay Prevention

**Scenario:** A 200-station assembly line project running behind schedule

**Without SimPilot:**

- Project managers check status weekly via email & manual reports
- By week 12, realize 30 stations are 3 weeks behind
- Too late to reallocate engineers and resources
- Project misses deadline by 4 weeks
- **Cost: $250K/week × 4 weeks = $1M delay impact**

**With SimPilot:**

- Dashboard shows schedule risk in real-time
- By week 8, system flags 30 stations trending late (2 weeks earlier)
- Manager reallocates 5 engineers to at-risk stations
- Crisis prevented; project finishes 2 weeks late instead of 4
- **Savings: $500K** (only $250K impact vs. $1M without visibility)

---

### Example 2: The $200K Duplicate Tool Purchase

**Scenario:** Company buys new tooling for assembly line project

**Without SimPilot:**

- Procurement reviews old emails and files for past tooling
- Finds no record of tool "XYZ-200" (data was in someone's laptop)
- Orders 50 units of XYZ-200 at $4K/unit = $200K purchase
- Discover 3 weeks later that 45 identical tools already exist in warehouse
- **Cost: $180K in waste** (can only return 20% after restocking fees)

**With SimPilot:**

- Registry page shows all tools, sourcing status, and location
- Query finds 47 XYZ-200 tools in stock from previous project
- Only order 3 units needed for new project
- **Savings: $188K** (no waste, only $12K for 3 new units)

---

### Example 3: The Robot Simulation Bottleneck Discovery

**Scenario:** Assembly line deployment waiting on robot simulation completion

**Without SimPilot:**

- Monthly status meeting reveals "robot simulations not done"
- Too vague to know which robots or what stage
- Take 1 week to track down details across emails
- Discover 15 robots still need offline programming (4 weeks of work)
- Deployment delayed 4 weeks while programming happens
- **Cost: $1M in delay** (assembly line startup delayed, factory idle)

**With SimPilot:**

- Robot Simulation page shows real-time completion status
- By week 3, identify 15 robots at risk (offline phase incomplete)
- Coordinate with robot programming team immediately
- Bring in contract resources; complete in 2 weeks instead of 4
- **Savings: $500K** (only 2-week delay vs. 4-week without visibility)

---

### Example 4: The Data Quality Crisis Averted

**Scenario:** Major plant receiving incorrect robot programming data

**Without SimPilot:**

- 50K rows of simulation data ingested via email & manual file copy
- Nobody validates the data quality until robots arrive at plant
- Discovery: 200 robot assignments are wrong (different tool than specified)
- Must halt plant startup for 3 weeks to correct programming
- **Cost: $750K** (plant idle, engineering emergency response, rework)

**With SimPilot:**

- Data Health page flags 200 records with quality issues immediately
- Data validation catches assignments that don't match tool specifications
- Error identified same day; corrected before shipment
- Plant startup proceeds on schedule
- **Savings: $750K** (quality issue caught before impact)

---

### Example 5: The Deployment Readiness Success

**Scenario:** Station deployment to plant floor

**Without SimPilot:**

- Manager assumes station is "ready" based on informal status
- Station ships before robot simulation completed
- Plant floor discovers programming incomplete; cannot run
- Costs 2 weeks of emergency on-site programming at triple rates
- **Cost: $200K** (delay + expensive rework + lost production)

**With SimPilot:**

- Readiness Board shows exact status before deployment
- Checklist confirms: simulation complete ✓, tooling ready ✓, but robot programming ✗
- Delay shipping 1 week to complete programming before plant arrival
- Station arrives ready; production runs immediately
- **Savings: $200K** (prevented on-site emergency costs)
